# Advent-of-Code-2022

My attempts to solve the riddles of the Advent of Code 2022. I mainly use Python to figure out a working solution. My solutions are far from being perfect â€“ as an undergraduate student of Linguistics my main goal is to enjoy programming and have fun!

Note:
Advent of Code 2022 is a programming challenge. All the credits for the riddles go to Eric Wastl who is the maker of Advent of Code 2022. The solutions are my own.
